    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pound mascarpone cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>¼ cup strong brewed coffee, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rum</li>
        <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ladyfinger cookies</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
